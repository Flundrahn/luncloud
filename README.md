## Ideas
- File upload
- File download
- Auth with users and sharing files
- Onion architecture
- Separate the layers enough that we later can add on ui from different frameworks, and possibly switch data layer implementation.
- Add Blazor WebAssembly GUI
- Add Android kotlin GUI
- Add SQLite database
- Add other type of db, document or graph
- Add a gRPC service

## Get started
To restore dependencies and run app:

```bash
dotnet run --project .\src\WebApi\
```
